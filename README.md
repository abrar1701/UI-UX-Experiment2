## 🎨 Brand Logo and Styling Guidelines (Requirement D)

### Logo Design
> *[Insert your final Logo .png or .jpg file here]* > `![Brand Logo](./path-to-your-logo.png)`

### Branding Guidelines
* **Brand Name:** [e.g., "CareerConnect", "Artify", "RoomieFind"]
* **Tone & Voice:** [e.g., "Professional and trustworthy," "Creative and inspiring"]

### Color Palette
| Usage | Color Name | Hex Code |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary** | Brand Blue | `#4A90E2` |
| **Secondary** | Accent Orange | `#F5A623` |
| **Neutral (Dark)** | Dark Gray (Text) | `#333333` |
| **Neutral (Light)** | Light Gray (Background) | `#F9F9F9` |

### Typography
* **Heading Font:** "Montserrat" (Bold) - *24pt (Web) / 20pt (Mobile)*
* **Body Font:** "Roboto" (Regular) - *16pt (Web) / 14pt (Mobile)*

## 🖥️ Web Layout Design (Desktop)
*This layout prioritizes clarity and common user paths for a desktop experience.*

### Web Wireframe
> *[Insert your Web Layout Wireframe image here]* > `![Web Wireframe](./path-to-web-wireframe.png)`

### UI Elements and Design Patterns (Requirement B)
* **Header / Navigation Bar**
    * Logo placed in the top-left (standard convention).
    * Navigation links (e.g., "Home," "Features") are horizontally arranged.
    * Primary CTA button (e.g., "Sign Up") on the far right using the primary brand color.
* **Hero Section**
    * Large, compelling headline (e.g., "Find Your Perfect Roommate").
    * Includes a short subheading and secondary CTA.
* **Card Layout**
    * Used to display key features in a grid.
    * Each card contains an image, title, and short description.
* **Footer**
    * Contains secondary navigation, social links, and copyright info.

## 📱 Mobile Layout Design
*This layout is adapted for a single-column, touch-first experience, prioritizing essential content.*

### Mobile Wireframe
> *[Insert your Mobile Layout Wireframe image here]* > `![Mobile Wireframe](./path-to-mobile-wireframe.png)`

### UI Elements and Design Patterns (Requirement B)
* **Mobile Header**
    * Logo remains present.
    * Navigation links collapsed into a **"Hamburger Menu"** icon.
* **Off-Canvas Menu**
    * Tapping the icon reveals links in a slide-out menu.
* **Content Stacking**
    * Web grid layout is stacked into a single vertical column for easy scrolling.
* **Bottom Navigation Bar** (Optional)
    * Persistent bar for 2-4 critical actions (Home, Search, Profile) for thumb accessibility.

## 🧠 Application of Gestalt Principles (Requirement A)

1.  **Principle of Proximity**
    * *Application:* UI elements that belong together (e.g., icon, title, description in a card) are grouped closely, while the card itself is separated from others by whitespace.
2.  **Principle of Similarity**
    * *Application:* Interactive elements share styles. All primary CTA buttons use the Primary Color; all text links are colored/underlined similarly.
3.  **Principle of Common Region**
    * *Application:* Distinct background colors group elements. The Header and Footer have different shades than the main content to separate page structure.
4.  **Principle of Closure**
    * *Application:* Cards use simple borders or shadows. The user perceives the elements within as a single unit, even without heavy boxing.

---

## 👆 Interaction Behaviors and Usability (Requirement C)

### Interaction Behaviors
* **Hover States (Web):** Links/buttons change color or underline on mouse-over. Cards have a subtle "lift" (box-shadow).
* **Active/Pressed States:** Buttons darken when pressed. Current page in nav is highlighted.
* **Feedback:** Forms use green outlines for valid input and red for errors. Loading spinners appear upon submission.

### Usability Principles (Nielsen's Heuristics)
* **Visibility of System Status:** Users are informed via active nav links, spinners, and success/error messages.
* **Consistency and Standards:** Follows conventions (Logo top-left, Hamburger menu on mobile).
* **Aesthetic and Minimalist Design:** Generous whitespace and clutter-free layout to reduce cognitive load.
* **Flexibility and Efficiency:** Mouse users get horizontal nav; touch users get bottom nav/stacked content.
